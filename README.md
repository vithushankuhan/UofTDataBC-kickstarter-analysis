# kickstarter-analysis
## Overview and Purpose

Louise, an up-and-coming play writer, is looking to run a kickstarter campaign to help fund her play *Fever*. She has reached out to me to help her with this task.
Louise would like to know how other similar play campaigns performed based on their launch date and funding goals. The purpose of this analysis is to uncover trends and insights from various kickstarter campaigns for plays. This will help Louise determine the appropriate funding launch date for her campaign. Louise estimates a budget of $10,000 for her play. Knowing this, I worked with Louise to put together an effective campaign strategy that will reduce costs and increase the amount of funding received. Data from over 4,000 campaigns was collected and filtered, and analyses on launch date and funding goals was conducted to uncover insight into the campaigns.

## Analysis and Challenges

In order to determine the appropirate launch date and funding for Louise's play, the analysis was into 'Outcomes By Launch Date' and 'Outcome Based on Goals'. Pivot tables, charts, and excel functions were used to organize, clean, and present the data. 

### Outcomes By Launch Date

The first analysis was aimed at understanding the outcomes of plays by launch date. We wanted to know if launching a campaign at a certain time in the year was more effective. A pivot table was created from the raw data, and filterd by year and parent category. The parent category for this analysis was 'theatre'. 

### Outcome Based on Goals

The second analysis was aimed at understanding the outomes of plays based on their funding goals. By conducing this analysis, Louise can determine the appropriate funding for her play. This data also shows the impact of having low and high funding goals. By looking at the table and chart, Louise can either lower, raise, or maintain her funding estimate.
