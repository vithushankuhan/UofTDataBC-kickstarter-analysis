# kickstarter-analysis
## Overview and Purpose

Louise, an up-and-coming play writer, is looking to run a kickstarter campaign to help fund her play *Fever*. She has reached out to me to help her with this task.
Louise would like to know how other similar campaigns performed based on their launch date and funding goals. The purpose of this analysis is to uncover trends and insights from various kickstarter campaigns around the world. This will help Louise determine the appropriate funding launch date for her campaign. Louise estimates a budget of $10,000 for her play. Knowing this, I worked with Louise to put together an effective campaign strategy that will reduce costs and increase the amount of funding received. Data from over 4,000 campaigns was collected and filtered, and analyses on launch date and funding goals was conducted to uncover insight into the campaigns.
