# Kickstarter Campaign Analysis
## Overview and Purpose

Louise, an up-and-coming play writer, is looking to run a kickstarter campaign to help fund her play *Fever*. She would like to know how other similar play campaigns performed based on their launch date and funding goals. The purpose of this analysis is to uncover trends and insights from various kickstarter campaigns for plays. This will help Louise determine the appropriate funding launch date for her campaign. Louise estimates a budget of $10,000 for her play. Knowing this, I worked with Louise to put together an effective campaign strategy that will reduce costs and increase the amount of funding received. Data from over 4,000 campaigns was collected and filtered, and analyses on launch date and funding goals was conducted to uncover insight into the campaigns. Findings from the analysis will be presented with charts and graphs to provide Louise with the information she needs.

## Analysis and Challenges

In order to determine the appropirate launch date and funding for Louise's play the analysis was split into two parts, 'Outcomes By Launch Date' and 'Outcome Based on Goals'. Pivot tables, charts, and excel functions were used to organize, clean, and present the data. 

### Outcomes By Launch Date

The first analysis was aimed at understanding the outcomes of plays by launch date. We wanted to know if launching a campaign at a certain time in the year was more effective. A pivot table was created from the raw data, and filterd by year and parent category. The parent category for this analysis was 'theatre'. 

### Outcome Based on Goals

The second analysis was aimed at understanding the outomes of plays based on their funding goals. By conducing this analysis, Louise can determine the appropriate funding for her play. This data also shows the impact of having low and high funding goals. By looking at the table and chart, Louise can either lower, raise, or maintain her funding estimate. 

### Challenges and Limitations

- Challenge/Limitation 1: One piece of information that would be useful in determining the funding Louise should plan to recieve is the length of her campaign. By taking into consideration the campaigns duration can assist in creating a more accurate budget which will help Louise determine how much she will ened to raise in order to successsfully run her campaign. Additionally, knowing the length of her campaign can help us compare similar campaigns with her desired duration and find insight into how to efficiently run a campaign for her desired duration. 
- Challenge/Limitation 2: The information we worked with only looks at campaigns from 2009-2017. It would be useful to have data from recent years as it would allow for a more accurate representation of what Louise can expect in today's entertainment landscape. Things have definetly changed over the past few years, and knowing what we know now, it may not be the ebst idea to raise funding for a play that might not happen for months under the current circumstances. Having recent data can help use determine trends in today's environement and provide Louise a more accurate picture.  

## Results

### Theater Outcomes by Launch Date

- Conclusion 1: We can see that the time of year does has an impact on the success of campaigns. Looking at the chart, it is clear that launching a campaign in the summer is most effective. More specifically, the months May, June, and July result in the most successful campaigns. The opposite is true for the winter months. Since the summer months, there is a clear decline in successful campaigns, with the month of December having only 37 successful campaigns. Although there are successful campaigns in November, December, and January, it significantly less than the summer months. Therefore it is clear that Louise should aim to run her campaign in May, June, or July. 
- Conclusion 2: While May, June, and July have the most number of successful campaigns, the three months also have the highest number of failed campaigns, and the highest number of campaigns overall. What this could mean is that competition in these months is high, and as a result many campaigns may not reach its funding goal as people may prefer to support another campaign that they like more. Therefore, if Louise does plan to launch her campaign in the summer she will need to do extensive reseearch on other playwriteers who are also launching a campaign during the same time. This will allow Louise to present a much more appealing campaign, and reach her fundraising goal.

### Outcomes based on Goals
